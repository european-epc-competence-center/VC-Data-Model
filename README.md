# VC-Data-Model
This is the repository for discussing and developing GS1's data model as used in Verifiable Credentials.

The data mode document itself is versioned. The latest version is always available at https://ref.gs1.org/gs1/vc/data-model/ with current and previous versions in the [[Archive](https://ref.gs1.org/gs1/vc/data-model/archive)].

The model is supported by a number of ontologies and JSON-LD context files. All assets related to GS1's work on <abbr title="Verifiable Credentials">VC</abbr>s are listed at https://ref.gs1.org/gs1/vc/. The machine-readable files published on ref.gs1.org are snapshots of those developed here. You are welcome to raise and discuss issues here, however, please note the licensing conditions for this repository. Nothing in this work constitutes a GS1 standard and it is not covered by our [IP policy](https://www.gs1.org/standards/ip). Do not contribute any work here over which you may later wish to assert your own IP. Work here is shared publicly and all contributions are themselves public.

All documents in this repository should be considered as suitable for experiments, demos and pilots. At the time of writing, GS1 has not made any commitment to develop and maintain a formal data model. Nevertheless, the existence of these artefacts is a manifestation of a sincere interest in the technology and an expectation of future development.
