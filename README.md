# VC-Data-Model
This is the repository for discussing and developing GS1's data model as used in Verifiable Credentials.

The data mode document itself is versioned. The latest version is always available at https://ref.gs1.org/gs1/vc/data-model/ [[Archive](https://ref.gs1.org/gs1/vc/data-model/archive)].

The model is supported by a number of ontologies and JSON-LD context files. All assets related to GS1's work on <abbr title="Verifiable Credentials">VC</abbr>s are listed at https://ref.gs1.org/gs1/vc/.
